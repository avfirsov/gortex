A Gortex daemon is configured machine-wide via the ` + "`" + `gortex` + "`" + ` MCP server.

Graph queries *narrow scope*; they do not replace reading the implementation. For the symbol you are about to change or depend on — especially behavior-critical code (migrations, retry / fallback / error-recovery paths, concurrency, compatibility shims) — read the real body with ` + "`" + `get_symbol_source` + "`" + ` and do NOT pass ` + "`" + `compress_bodies:true` + "`" + `, which elides the branches that carry the risk. ` + "`" + `format:"gcx"` + "`" + ` (compact wire, ~27% fewer tokens) and ` + "`" + `compress_bodies:true` + "`" + ` (body-eliding) exist on the read / list tools; the parameter legend is in the MCP server instructions.

## MANDATORY: Session + development memory

The graph remembers code; these tools remember **why you made a call**. They are behavior-critical — run each at its trigger, not "optionally":

- **Session start / after a compaction** — call ` + "`" + `distill_session` + "`" + ` first: prior top symbols, pinned notes, decisions, recent excerpts. Seed your mental model before reading any file.
- **Immediately after ` + "`" + `smart_context` + "`" + `** — call ` + "`" + `surface_memories task:"<task>" symbol_ids:"<top hits>"` + "`" + `: cross-session invariants / gotchas / decisions anchored to your working set. If it returns nothing, don't probe further.
- **At every decision** — pick an approach, reject an alternative, hit a non-obvious constraint, or commit to an invariant → ` + "`" + `save_note tags:"decision" body:"<what+why>"` + "`" + `. Mention symbol IDs (` + "`" + `pkg/foo.go::Bar` + "`" + `) in the body for auto-linking; ` + "`" + `pinned:true` + "`" + ` for load-bearing notes.
- **When you learn a durable fact worth teaching the team** — ` + "`" + `store_memory kind:"<invariant|gotcha|convention|decision|constraint|incident>" body:"<what+why>" symbol_ids:"<id>" importance:5` + "`" + `. ` + "`" + `save_note` + "`" + ` is the per-session scratchpad; ` + "`" + `store_memory` + "`" + ` is the workspace-wide store every future agent inherits. Supersede a stale memory with ` + "`" + `supersedes:"<old-id>"` + "`" + `.
- **Before editing a symbol you've touched before** — ` + "`" + `query_notes symbol_id:"<id>"` + "`" + ` / ` + "`" + `query_memories symbol_id:"<id>"` + "`" + ` surface prior decisions and "do not change this without …" warnings.

**Save / store:** decisions, non-obvious constraints, invariants, follow-ups, incident learnings, bug reproductions. **Skip:** play-by-play the diff already shows, anything derivable from the graph, content already in CLAUDE.md.

## Reference and discovery

- **` + "`" + `gortex://guide` + "`" + ` resource** (or the ` + "`" + `gortex guide [topic]` + "`" + ` CLI) is the full reference: LLM-provider matrix, capabilities catalog, analyze / search_ast catalogs, token-economy detail, MCP resources, session-start checklist. Read it on demand — it is not pre-paid here.
- **` + "`" + `tools_search` + "`" + `** — the server publishes a lean tool preset eagerly and defers the rest; call ` + "`" + `tools_search` + "`" + ` to discover and load any tool by keyword (every tool stays callable by name).
- The SessionStart hook injects daemon status. "daemon is not running" → run ` + "`" + `gortex daemon start --detach` + "`" + `; "cwd is not covered by any tracked repo" → graph tools are unavailable there.
`

// InstructionsBody is the shared rule block every adapter writes to
// its agent's instructions file. Tool names in the tables (Read, Grep)
// are Claude-Code-specific flavour; models outside Claude Code read
// them as "any file-reading tool" — the principle stays the same so
// we keep one body rather than branch by agent.
